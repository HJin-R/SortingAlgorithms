# sorting_algorithms

Simple sorting algorithms implemented in Java. Some codes are translated and modified based on the psudocode examples
in 'Introduction to Algorithm' - 4th edition 2022, Cormen, Lieserson, Rivest, Stein. MIT Press.

Keep in mind psudocode uses 1 as first index on array but in Java first index is 0.

main methods on some files includes an unsorted array to test if the methods are working properly.
